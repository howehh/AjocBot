     - Cytube username and password fields are login for bot
     - socketConnection is the URL you are connecting to (ex: https://zip.cytu.be:10443)
     - channel is the name of the cytube channel to connect to
     - gist username and password fields are login for github
     - openweathermapKey is API key from https://openweathermap.org/
     - twitchKey is API key from twitch.tv<br>
   
2. Install node and npm
3. `cd` into AjocBot folder through command prompt
4. `npm install` the node modules listed under package.json
